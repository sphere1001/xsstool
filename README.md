# xsstool
a little helper for finding xss vulnerabilities with google

this tool checks google sites with dorks to scan for xss vulnerabilities.
Nothing special ,but in my comfort zone.
For best resul√∂ts try with a VPN.
Use it with two command line arguments ,like : python3 xsstool.py <dork> <number of search pages>
